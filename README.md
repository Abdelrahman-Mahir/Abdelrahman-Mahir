Hellooo there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

This is a quick intro about myself: 
I'm a Petroleum engineering graduate, working as a business developer while doing a Master's in Civil Engineering. 
I started to learn programming because it's one of those tools that can literally transfer ideas into reality, and at a relatively low cost.

I'm currently going through the Udemy course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" by Dr. Angela Yu, and I'm enjoying the process so far.
The next step for me is to start the CS50 Harvard course. As for what's beyond that, I'm not very clear yet, since web development is an enticing prospect for me, also there's the option of going into data science. 

I haven't decided yet, but I'm definitely looking forward to what's ahead.
